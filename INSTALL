Installation Instructions
=========================

This file describes how to compile and install eWoms. In this context
it is useful to keep in mind that eWoms is implemented as a DUNE
module, i.e., the generic build instructions for DUNE modules should
apply [3].

Prerequisites
-------------

The OPM software stack -- and by extension eWoms -- is firmly target
at the Linux platform and requires a relatively recent C++
compiler. Thus, be aware that even though you are encouraged to try to
build and run the software on other plattforms, your mileage may vary
considerably in that case.

In order to compile eWoms, you first need to install the following OPM
and DUNE modules:

  - opm-material        from [1] or [2]
  - opm-common          from [1] or [2]
  - dune-common         from [0]
  - dune-geometry       from [0]
  - dune-grid           from [0]
  - dune-istl           from [0]
  - dune-localfunctions from [0]

To use the ECL Black-Oil Simulator (ebos), the following OPM modules
are also required:

  - opm-parser         from [1] or [2]
  - opm-grid           from [1] or [2]
  - opm-core           from [1] or [2]

If you want to use the latest eWoms development version, the latest
release of the DUNE prerequisites usually works best, for the OPM
prerequisites, the latest master branches need to be used.

Note: Many Linux distributions ship DUNE packages. For reasonably
current distributions, these packages can be used as an alternative to
installing DUNE manually [1].

Building
--------

The easiest way to compile eWoms is to follow the generic installation
procedure for DUNE modules, i.e., to use the dunecontrol script [4].
For your convenience, the eWoms source tree ships with a few
ready-made option files for dunecontrol. These files can be found on
the topmost level of the source tree and exhibit the '.opts'
extension. It is advisable to adapt these to your particular needs
before you start the build.

After the prerequisites have been dealt with, you can compile eWoms
using

  cd $EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/..
  $PATH_TO_DUNECONTROL/dunecontrol --opts=$EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/optim.opts --module=ewoms all

Depending on the dunecontrol option file used, the test simulators are
not compiled by default in order to speed up the build process for
downstream modules. If you want to force a given test simulator to be
compiled, use e.g.,

  cd $EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/build-cmake
  make lens_immiscible_ecfv_ad

to compile the `lens_immiscible_ecfv_ad` executable. Compiling all
available tests can be achieved via

  cd $EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/build-cmake
  make test-suite

Installing
----------

If you are not interested in modifying eWoms, you can optionally
install it globally on your system. This can be done using

  cd $EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/build-cmake
  sudo make install

You can specify the target directory for the installation process by
adding -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$TARGET_DIR to the CMAKE_FLAGS variable
in the dunecontrol option file that you used for build proceedure.


Getting started
===============

Once the compilation is done, the produced executables can be found in
the directory $EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/build-cmake/bin. To use them, it is
usually sufficient to simply run the binary of interest from the
command line without any arguments. For example, to run the simulator
for the two-dimensional 'lens' problem that utilizes a multi-phase
model which assumes immiscibility of the fluid phases in conjunction
with the element centered finite volume discretization and automatic
differentiation, type

  cd $EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/build-cmake
  ./bin/lens_immiscible_ecfv_ad

This produces a sequence of VTK files which can be visualized using,
for example, ParaView [4]:

  paraview --data=lens_immiscible_ecfv_ad.pvd

You may also specify command line parameters to alter the behavior of
the simulation. The list of recognized parameters and their
descriptions can usually be obtained by the '--help' command line
argument, e.g.,

  cd $EWOMS_SOURCE_DIR/build-cmake
  ./bin/lens_immiscible_ecfv_ad --help
